    <p>This cedar plank salmon recipe delivers wonderfully smoky flavor that your dinner guests won’t be able to resist. Grilling on a cedar plank gives salmon a subtle smokiness that adds complexity and takes the flavor up a notch. Plus, grilling on a plank means you don’t have to worry about the salmon falling through the grill grates. Salmon cooked on soaked cedar planks on a grill preheated to medium heat should flake perfectly with a fork after about 20 minutes. Don’t forget that the fish will continue to cook after it is removed from the heat. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 (12 inch) untreated cedar planks</li>
        <li>⅓ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped green onions</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 (2 pound) salmon fillets, skin removed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>Soak cedar planks for at least 1 hour in warm water. Soak longer if you have time.</li>
        <li>Stir soy sauce, vegetable oil, rice vinegar, sesame oil, green onions, ginger, and garlic together in a shallow dish.</li>
        <li>Place salmon fillets in soy mixture and turn to coat. Cover and marinate for at least 15 minutes, or up to 1 hour refrigerated.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat. Place planks on the grill grate. Heat planks until they start to smoke and crackle just a little.</li>
        <li>Remove salmon from marinade and place on planks; discard marinade.</li>
        <li>Close grill cover. Grill salmon until it flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes; salmon will continue to cook after you remove it from the grill.</li>
    </ol>
